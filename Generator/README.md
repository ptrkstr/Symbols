## Aren't there already packages like this?

Yep! But for one reason or another, they didn't fulfil my needs (as of 2021/11/05).

- [lennet/Symbols](https://github.com/lennet/symbols) - No updates since June 2019
- [piknotech/SFSafeSymbols](https://github.com/piknotech/SFSafeSymbols) - Missing support for SFSymbols 3 ([issue since 8 June](https://github.com/piknotech/SFSafeSymbols/issues/75))
- [abadikaka/SFSymbolsFinder](https://github.com/abadikaka/SFSymbolsFinder) - Feature rich package, but I wanted something lean
- [jollyjinx/SFSymbolEnum](https://github.com/jollyjinx/SFSymbolEnum) - Has availability checks built in but swift package index shows build breaking with iOS
- [justMaku/Symbolic](https://github.com/justmaku/symbolic) - No updates since June 2019
- [omeasraf/SFIcons ](https://github.com/omeasraf/SFIcons) - Swift package index shows build breaking with iOS
